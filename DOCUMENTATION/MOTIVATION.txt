Motivation
==========

The existing LUKS/dm-crypt based implementation for full-disk-encryption on Linux
implies dedicated passwords/passphases for LUKS/dm-crypt. For the average users
this implies that they have to remember two separate credentials, one for the
full-disk-encryption and one for their system login users. Although this allows
for a cryptographically stronger secret to be employed for the full-disk-encryption
while allowing for a simpler login password (that users would have to type in more
oftenly: to unlock the screensaver). However, most users would simply choose the same
password for both subsystems and thus not benefiting from this possibility. On the
downside this incurs a higher password management overhead when changing passwords.
Also, some users may find it unintuitive to maintain two separate passwords.


Scope definition
================

TokenTube shall implement a subsystem for Linux systems that enables users to employ
their system login credentials for the pre-boot-authentication (PBA) in order to
mount an LUKS/dm-crypt encrypted system partition/filesystem. The implementation shall
address password changes and other user-management related changes automatically and
by that be virtually unnoticably for users.
