Concept
=======

The environment variable TT_DEBUG_LEVEL is evaluated and checked which debug-level
should be used. If unset then no debug output is generated, otherwise the environment
variable will be interpreted as an integer and any debug statments with a debug level
equal to or lower than the set debug level will be written to stderr (unless the
environment variable TT_DEBUG_SOURCE is set and does not match the source component
of the debug message). 

Debug data might contain user/system related information but will not include
sensitive data like passwords or keys.


Levels
======

Level 0: Reserved (used only for duplicating LOG entries to debug output)
Level 1: Information about the lifecycle state (initialization, configuration,
         loading of plugins, finalization) and error-related debugging information.
Level 2: High level debug information and configuration details 
Level 3: Low level debug information and control flow API/plugins
Level 4: Low level debug information and control flow debugging information within functions
Level 5: Data debugging
